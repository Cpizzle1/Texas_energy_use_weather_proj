# Old Abandoned Project

Was going to investigate energy usage in Texas in relation to weather effects. Pulling weather data for Dallas specifically, and pulling energy data from EIA.gov. Project was abandoned because someone had a similar project. Only got to EDA and some data basic analysis.  Figured I'd put it up for backup.

*airport weather data/codes couse be used in the future
